AstroGenesis: Chronicles of the Starborn

A demo using Generative AI to procedurally generate environments and render them using Three.js.

In AstroGenesis, the player is a Starborn, an entity capable of creating and nurturing life on barren planets. The goal is to terraform procedurally generated planets and create a sustainable ecosystem.

### Procedural Planet Generation
The AI model's output, assuming it's exposed at a local URL, is utilized in a Three.js game.
Coming shortly, the server-side implementation to develop the Generative AI model, which given an input seed, generates a blueprint for a planet. The blueprint includes information about the terrain type, the atmospheric conditions, potential resources, etc.

### Planet Rendering
Three.js, based on the information received from the server, would render the planet visually. The terrain would be created, atmosphere depicted, and resources placed accordingly.

### Gameplay
The gameplay would involve the player using tools to terraform the planet. Three.js would be responsible for handling user inputs, physics, and game logic.

This game concept exemplifies the potential of integrating Generative AI with Three.js to create an engaging gaming experience.
